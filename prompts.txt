Design a "go link" short URL server using python. It has a sqlite database of
short links, each of which redirects to a full URL.

Additionally, if an unused short link is accessed, it redirects to a "new link"
page where the user can add a full URL corresponding to the requested short
link.

Include stubs for user authentication and authorization, so that new links can
be associated with their creators and existing links can only be edited by
their creators.
